I created a table named teacher with the columns name, age, salary, and subject. After inserting data into the table, I grouped the records by the subject column. Then, I applied aggregate functions — SUM, COUNT, and AVG — on the salary column for each subject group. Finally, I used the HAVING clause to filter subjects having more than two teachers.
